# Latest Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Profile Image Face Getting Cut Off** ✅
**Problem**: Profile image was using `object-cover` which was cropping the face
**Solution**: 
- Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` 
- Added `overflow-hidden` to the container
- This ensures the full image is visible without cropping

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Before: object-cover (crops image)
<img src={profile} alt="Profile" className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full" />

// After: object-contain (shows full image)
<img src={profile} alt="Profile" className="w-full h-full object-contain rounded-full" />
```

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Dark Mode Button** ✅
**Problem**: There were two dark mode toggle buttons - one in navbar and one floating
**Solution**: 
- Removed the duplicate floating dark mode button outside navbar
- Kept only the navbar dark mode toggle for cleaner UI

### 3. **Fixed Home Page Content Arrangement** ✅
**Problem**: Contact cards layout was inconsistent and not properly aligned
**Solution**:
- Made all contact cards consistent (Email, Phone, Location)
- Improved spacing and padding
- Added proper full email address
- Made cards more responsive and better organized
- Fixed icon positioning and sizing

### 4. **Fixed Dark Mode in Projects Page** ✅
**Problem**: Several elements in ProjectsPage weren't adapting to dark mode
**Solution**: Fixed dark mode styling for:
- Project type badges
- Project titles and descriptions
- Technology tags background
- Project highlight cards
- Progress bars background
- "Coming Soon" section
- All text colors and backgrounds

### 5. **Enhanced Dark Mode Support** ✅
**Additional Improvements**:
- Fixed floating icons around profile image to adapt to dark mode
- Updated particles toggle button to change colors in dark mode
- Improved button styling consistency across light/dark themes
- Fixed all text contrast ratios for better accessibility

## Technical Details:

### Profile Image Fix:
```css
/* Container with overflow hidden */
<div className="w-80 h-80 bg-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center shadow-inner overflow-hidden">
  <img src={profile} alt="Profile" className="w-full h-full object-contain rounded-full" />
</div>
```

### Contact Cards Improvement:
```javascript
// Consistent layout for all cards
<div className={`flex flex-col items-center justify-center space-y-2 p-4 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 ${darkMode ? 'bg-gray-800/80' : 'bg-white/80'}`}>
  <div className="p-3 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 rounded-xl mb-2">
    <Mail className="text-white" size={20} />
  </div>
  <p className={`text-sm font-medium ${darkMode ? 'text-gray-400' : 'text-gray-500'}`}>Email</p>
  <p className={`text-sm font-semibold text-center ${darkMode ? 'text-gray-200' : 'text-gray-800'}`}>pooja.sharma001011@gmail.com</p>
</div>
```

### Dark Mode Conditional Styling Pattern:
```javascript
className={`base-classes ${darkMode ? 'dark-classes' : 'light-classes'}`}
```
